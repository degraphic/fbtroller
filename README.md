TODO:
- register accessToken (in memcache) for logout if token expired
- remove all jobs tagged with access_token

- define possible filters
- add filter fields as separate columns: types, friend groups
- retrieve user names from uids on server and query them in the table

NEXT version:
- add iframe with fb login to get action links for deleting posts / making them private (if possible?)
